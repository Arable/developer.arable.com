## Understanding the Schema

The [schemas](https://api.arable.cloud/api/v2/doc#operation/get_schemas) and [tables](https://api.arable.cloud/api/v2/doc#operation/get_schema) endpoints were intended to show the descriptions of the data that is available within the Arable platform.

Fetching the available tables is the first step.

Example:
```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://api.arable.cloud/api/v2/schemas \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdEB0ZXN0LmNvbTpnZXRtZWRhdGE=' \
```

The result will be an array of table names. Each of these table names can be used in a subsequent call where it becomes the URL parameter to the `/schemas` endpoint. To get the metadata for the `daily` table, for example, you would specify `/schemas/daily`.

Example: 
```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://api.arable.cloud/api/v2/schemas/daily \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdEB0ZXN0LmNvbTpnZXRtZWRhdGE=' \
```

The result is an array of JSON objects that contain the metadata for a column including `description`, `data_type`, and `column_name`. 

Example:
```text
[
    {
        "description": "UTC time",
        "data_type": "timestamp with time zone",
        "column_name": "create_time"
    },
    {
        "description": "Crop water demand (mm/day)",
        "data_type": "real",
        "column_name": "crop_water_demand"
    },
    ...
]
```

This information can be helpful when interpreting the returned data or for narrowing down the requested data to only the necessary/selected columns.

## Requesting Data

The [data](https://api.arable.cloud/api/v2/doc#operation/get_data) endpoint provides access to time series data from a specified table. It takes the name of the table to query as a path parameter, and returns data in JSON or CSV format depending on the value of an optional `Accept` header (the default is JSON).

Results are paginated as described under the Cursor Pagination section of these docs. Data units are converted according to the unit parameters provided on the request (example below). The data endpoint also accepts several filtering parameters:

- `device`: device name, e.g. A123456; one `device` and one `location` is required;
- `location`: location id; one `device` and one `location` is required;
- `select`: comma-separated string of requested column names (default is all available columns). More detail on when to use this can be found [here](column-filtering.md#select);
- `start_time`: query start time as an iso-formatted string (default depends on the table queried);
- `end_time`: query end time as an iso-formatted string (default is the current time).
- `limit`: limit the number of records returned from a query (see information about [default limits](data.md#data-limits))

It also accepts a result formatting option:
- `local_time`: there are three potential input formats. If included on the request, the results will include a `local_time` column with `time`: converted to the specified time zone or offset by the specified amount of time. Though most tables store data in UTC, there are a few tables which do not and are detailed [here](#table-timezones). The three potential formats are:
  - Time zone name (e.g., `America/Los_Angeles` which is UTC-7 or UTC-8 depending on daylight savings time, or DST). This is a DST-aware format and will return the correct local time even if the data crosses the switch-over period between DST and regular time.
  - ISO format (e.g. `-04:00` which is UTC-4). This is a flat offset in hours and minutes from UTC. This is not DST-aware.
  - Offset in seconds (e.g. `-25200` which is UTC-7). This is a flat offset in seconds from UTC. This is not DST-aware.

Example (JSON):

```bash
curl -i \
  -G https://api.arable.cloud/api/v2/data/hourly \
  -H "Authorization: Apikey <apikey>" \
  -d "select=time,tair,rh,slp,precip" \
  -d "device=A123456" \
  -d "limit=10" \
  -d "start_time=2019-07-01" \
  -d "end_time=2019-07-01T12:00:00Z" \
  -d "local_time=-14400"
```

## Time Zones

Time zones are a difficult issue in general, and in particular for remote sensed data. The Arable platform attempts to make it easy for the user to view the data in the time zone that they want. 


Data in the Arable platform is generally stored in [Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (UTC) time. 

- The `Location` resource has a `tz_name` property which specifies the time zone local to the location where the device was recording data - or "device local time."

- On the `/data` endpoint there is a `local_time` parameter if you require the time to be converted to a local time (or specifically not UTC). This is where the output of the `tz_name` can be specified. 

- The `daily` table is stored in device local time. As this table contains aggregations, averages, and extremes from a day, it is most meaningful that the table show the local 00:00 to 23:59:59 day and not the UTC 00:00 to 23:59 day.

- The `local_hourly` table is stored in UTC time and aggregated in device local time. Fetching this information will require the user to specify the `local_time` parameter, otherwise the information will be shown in UTC time.

- The `hourly` table is aggregated and stored in UTC time. This is recommended for scientific usage to compare data across sites, ignoring time zone. 


## Unit Conversion

With each request of data, unit conversion can be performed based upon the class of measurement. For instance, for hourly data, there might be average, minimum, and maximum temperatures, but in order to convert all of them you must specify only one argument of `temp`.

Example:
```
/data/hourly?temp=f
```

| Parameter  | Units  | Description   |
|---|---|---|
| temp  | **c*, f  | Temperature in either Celsius or Fahrenheit  |
| pres  | **mb*, kp  | Pressure (e.g., sea level pressure) in either millibars or kilopascals   |
| size | **mm*, in  | Size (e.g., rain) in either millimeters or inches   |
| ratio | **pct*, dec  | Ratios (e.g., relative humidity) in percentages or decimals  |
| speed | **mps*, kph, mph | Speed (e.g., wind speed) in meters per second, kilometers per hour, or miles per hour |
_* Denotes default_


## Data Limits

By default the data returned to the client is limited based upon time resolution. 
The more granular the data, the larger the default limit, but the fewer number of calendar days. 

| Resolution | Rows | Calendar Equivalent|
|---|---|---|
| 5 minute data| 2050 rows | ~7 days of data
|hourly| 2400 | 100 days
|daily| 730   | 2 years
